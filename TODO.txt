- mixin property references
- Better error handling
  - warnings/errors
  - Report as many errors as possible (don't break on first one)
  - Try to recover from errors (e.g. ignore missing imports, etc.)
  - Parser.displayRecognitionError (in pom.xml) sends error to error handler
  - ErrorHandler interface...handles warnings, errors.
