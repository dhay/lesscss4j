- mixin property references
- Support for expressions/variables in IE8's bogus syntax for opacity:
    -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=80)"
- dash-prefix.less doesn't resolve variables
- Better error handling
  - warnings/errors
  - Report as many errors as possible (don't break on first one)
  - Try to recover from errors (e.g. ignore missing imports, etc.)
