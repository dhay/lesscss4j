Compiler Algorithm

1. ANTLR -> AST
2. Walk AST to generate variable map and ruleset map (indexed by normalized selector) maintain order
3. walk ruleset map and generate CSS for each ruleset

Questions:
* Can Step 1 and 2 be combined? (i.e. Populate rulset and variable maps during parse and thus avoid AST completely)
* Is the AST necessary?
