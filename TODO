- Option to preserve comments
- only add .less during import if no file extension and file does not exist?
- test import of absolute url
- Variable expansion in URLs 
    @base: /some/base;
    .something { background-image: url('@base/myimage.png'); }
- Macro/Function/Syntax to Base64 encode image data
- It seems like handling of @media, @keyframes, @-webkit-keyframes, and maybe
  @page could all be handled the same way. Look at refactoring.
